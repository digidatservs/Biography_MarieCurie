            <p class="timeline__details">Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw on November 7, the daughter of teachers (her mother died when she was 11 years old) and her father, a math and physics teacher.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">She faced the tsarist regime (which excluded women from formal study) at a time when Poland was dominated by Russia. She was part of a group of young people who taught "underground" to working women, and later decided to leave Warsaw to go to Krakow, under Austrian rule.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">At 18, she held a position as a governess and financially helped her sister Bronislawa to graduate in Medicine in Paris.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">Maria, now in Paris, under the name Marie, undertook to study at the Sorbonne. She met 
            many famous academic physicists, and in 1893 managed to be the first place in the Bachelor of Physics. She worked 
            in laboratories, such as Gabriel Lippman's (physicist, Nobel Prize in 1908) and in 1894, she managed to be second 
            place in the degree in Mathematics.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details"> In 1894, she managed to be second place in the degree in Mathematics. In the spring 
            in this same year, Marie was introduced to the also renowned physicist Pierre Currie, through an academic meeting 
            promoted by the physicist Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, who noticed an interest in magnetism in both of them.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">She married Pierre Curie, who helped her set up her research laboratory, on the university 
            premises, after starting her doctoral thesis after learning about the discoveries of chemist Henri Becquerel, in 1896: 
            an invisible radiation emitted by uranium salts, which was called Becquerel rays.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">In 1897, Irène, the Currie's first child, was born. Marie, decided to find out if the 
            phosphorescence of uranium could also be found in other types of materials, and focused her searches on minerals.
            Marie, deciciu descobrir se a fosforescência do urânio também podia ser encontrada em outros tipos de materiais, 
            e concentrou suas buscas em minerais.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">In 1906, with the sudden death of Pierre (run over by a cart), Marie had to assume alone the continuity of the researches and was the 
            first woman to become a professor of General Physics at the Faculty of Sciences, after the vacancy of the position, left by your husband.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">In 1908 she assumed the position of full professor and in 1910 her fundamental treatise on radioactivity was published.</p>

              <p class="timeline__details">Marie saw the completion of construction of the laboratories of the Institute of Radio (Institut du Radium) at the University of Paris.
              She promoted, along with her daughter Irène, the use of radio to alleviate the suffering of soldiers during World War I.</p>                                  
              <p class="timeline__details">Both were dedicated to developing the use of X-Rayography.
              In 1918, the Radio Institute, which Irène joined the team, began to operate in earnest and would become a universal center for nuclear physics and chemistry.</p>
              <p class="timeline__details">In 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie was presented with 1 gram of radium
              by the President of the United States, Warren G. Harding, purchased through a collection among American women.</p>   
              <p class="timeline__details">In 1922, Marie Curie, famously, becomes a member of the Academy of Medicine, with research on the 
              study of the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical applications.</p>

              <p class="timeline__details">Of the 32 personalities present, at least 17 of them won the Nobel.</p>
              <p class="timeline__details">In the photo, standing in the background—left to right—scientists are Auguste Piccard, Émile Henriot, Paul Ehrenfest, Édouard Herzen, Theophile de Donder, Erwin Schrödinger, Jules-Émile Verschaffelt, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, Ralph Fowler and Léon Brillouin. In the middle row we have Peter Debye, Martin Knudsen, William Lawrence Bragg, Hendrik Anthony Kramers, Paul Dirac, Arthur Compton, Louis de Broglie, Max Born, and Niels Bohr.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">In 1929, on her second visit to the United States, this time overshadowed by 
            the great stock market crash, Marie received $50,000 in cash (raised from academic colleagues) from 
            President Hoover of the United States to invest in her radioactivity research in your hometown.</p>  
            <p class="timeline__details">Marie understood the importance of having a stockpile of radioactive sources, for applications 
            in medicine as well as for nuclear research.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">The stock of 1.5 grams of 
            radium at the Paris Institute of Radium ensured the continuity of research
            on radium D and polonium in the 1930s, and the experiences that stood out 
            were the studies by Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot, who carried out early 
            work for the discovery of the neutron, years later, by James Chadwick.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">A landmark year in Marie's history, for two reasons: the opportunity to follow her daughter Irène 
            and her husband Frédéric Joliot's discovery of artificial radioactivity and her death, shortly thereafter, of leukemia or, as 
            some sources also report, anemia plastic. Both diseases can be associated with prolonged exposure to chemicals and radioactive 
            elements.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">The Curies' legacy is wide, such as the Curie Institute, founded in 1909, in Paris, which houses 
            researchers, doctors and caregivers, who work in 3 locations (Paris, Saint-Cloud and Orsay).</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">The Curie Museum in Paris and the Museum in Warsaw, Poland.</p>  
            <p class="timeline__details">The University Paris 6 in France is called the Pierre and Marie Curie 
            University and the University in Lublin in Poland is the Marie Curie-Sklodowska University.</p>  
            <p class="timeline__details">Curie's story continued with great prominence for Iréne, and she received several honors 
            aimed at Marie's achievements, including in 1995, the consecration of the ashes of Marie and Pierre Curie at the Pantheon in Paris, 
            being the first woman to be honored for her account. on its own merits.</p>

            <p class="timeline__details">Irène Curie, following the family's 
            academic and scientific tradition, met and married her laboratory 
            colleague, chemical engineer Frédéric Joliot. This partnership 
            led them to win the Nobel, in 1935, artificially creating 
            radioactive atoms, which culminated in the use of radioisotypes, 
            which became precursors in the treatment of cancer, through 
            nuclear medicine.</p>
            <p class="timeline__details">Irène, also died of leukemia, on 
            march 17, 1956, at the age of 58, also from extensive exposure 
            to radiation, which occurred mainly after an accidental explosion 
            in her laboratory. Her children also continued in academic and 
            scientific life.</p>
